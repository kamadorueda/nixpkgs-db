It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible\ncodebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead.\n\nIt provides future and past packages with backports and forward ports\nof features from Python 3 and 2. It also comes with futurize and\npasteurize, customized 2to3-based scripts that helps you to convert\neither Py2 or Py3 code easily to support both Python 2 and 3 in a\nsingle clean Py3-style codebase, module by module.\n",
