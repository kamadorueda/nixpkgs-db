   "long_description": "To address the Internet\u2019s modern-day requirements with a better\nfitting model, PARC has created a new networking architecture\ncalled Content-Centric Networking (CCN), which operates by addressing\nand delivering Content Objects directly by Name instead of merely\naddressing network end-points. In addition, the CCN security model\nexplicitly secures individual Content Objects rather than securing\nthe connection or \u201cpipe\u201d. Named and secured content resides in\ndistributed caches automatically populated on demand or selectively\npre-populated. When requested by name, CCN delivers named content to\nthe user from the nearest cache, thereby traversing fewer network hops,\neliminating redundant requests, and consuming less resources overall.\n",
