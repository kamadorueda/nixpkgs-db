This includes socket timeouts and retries.\n- Robust HTTP-level retry layer.  Certain (user-adjustable) HTTP errors returned\n  by Amazon's services are classified as temporary errors.\n  These errors are automaticallly retried using exponentially increasing intervals.\n  The number of retries is user-configurable.\n- Fast REXML-based parsing of responses (as fast as a pure Ruby solution allows).\n- Uses libxml (if available) for faster response parsing.\n- Support for large S3 list operations.  Buckets and key subfolders containing\n  many (&gt; 1000) keys are listed in entirety.  Operations based on list (like\n  bucket clear) work on arbitrary numbers of keys.\n- Support for streaming GETs from S3, and streaming PUTs to S3 if the data source is a file.\n- Support for single-threaded usage, multithreaded usage, as well as usage with multiple\n  AWS accounts.\n- Support for both first- and second-generation SQS (API versions 2007-05-01\n  and 2008-01-01).  These versions of SQS are not compatible.\n- Support for signature versions 0 and 1 on SQS, SDB, and EC2.\n- Interoperability with any cloud running Eucalyptus (http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu)\n- Test suite (requires AWS account to do \"live\" testing).\n",
