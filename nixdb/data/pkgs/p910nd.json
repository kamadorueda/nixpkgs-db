   "long_description": "p910nd is a small printer daemon intended for diskless platforms that\ndoes not spool to disk but passes the job directly to the printer.\nNormally a lpr daemon on a spooling host connects to it with a TCP\nconnection on port 910n (where n=0, 1, or 2 for lp0, 1 and 2\nrespectively). p910nd is particularly useful for diskless platforms.\nCommon Unix Printing System (CUPS) supports this protocol, it's called\nthe AppSocket protocol and has the scheme socket://. LPRng also supports\nthis protocol and the syntax is lp=remotehost%9100 in /etc/printcap.\n",
