   "long_description": "\tPDF Redact Tools helps with securely redacting and stripping metadata\n\tfrom documents before publishing. Note that this is not a security tool.\n        It uses ImageMagick to parse PDFs.  While ImageMagick is a versatile tool, it has\n        a history of several security bugs. A malicious PDF could exploit a bug in\n        ImageMagick to take over your computer. If you're working with potentially\n        malicious PDFs, it's safest to run them through PDF Redact Tools in an isolated\n        environment, such as a virtual machine, or by using a tool such as the Qubes\n        PDF Converter instead.\n",
