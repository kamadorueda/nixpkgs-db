   "long_description": "Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and\n        other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.\n\n        Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file\n        called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and\n        how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, you\n        should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make\n        to build and install the program.\n",
