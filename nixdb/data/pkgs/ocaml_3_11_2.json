   "long_description": "Objective Caml is the most popular variant of the Caml language.\n        From a language standpoint, it extends the core Caml language with a\n        fully-fledged object-oriented layer, as well as a powerful module\n        system, all connected by a sound, polymorphic type system featuring\n        type inference.\n\n        The Objective Caml system is an industrial-strength implementation\n        of this language, featuring a high-performance native-code compiler\n        (ocamlopt) for 9 processor architectures (IA32, PowerPC, AMD64,\n        Alpha, Sparc, Mips, IA64, HPPA, StrongArm), as well as a bytecode\n        compiler (ocamlc) and an interactive read-eval-print loop (ocaml)\n        for quick development and portability.  The Objective Caml\n        distribution includes a comprehensive standard library, a replay\n        debugger (ocamldebug), lexer (ocamllex) and parser (ocamlyacc)\n        generators, a pre-processor pretty-printer (camlp4) and a\n        documentation generator (ocamldoc).\n",
