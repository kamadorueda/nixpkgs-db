   "long_description": "NEURON is a simulation environment for developing and exercising models of\n                neurons and networks of neurons. It is particularly well-suited to problems where\n                cable properties of cells play an important role, possibly including extracellular\n                potential close to the membrane), and where cell membrane properties are complex,\n                involving many ion-specific channels, ion accumulation, and second messengers",
