   "long_description": "Diff::LCS is a port of Perl's Algorithm::Diff that uses the McIlroy-Hunt\nlongest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compute intelligent differences\nbetween two sequenced enumerable containers. The implementation is based on\nMario I. Wolczko's {Smalltalk version 1.2}[ftp://st.cs.uiuc.edu/pub/Smalltalk/MANCHESTER/manchester/4.0/diff.st]\n(1993) and Ned Konz's Perl version\n{Algorithm::Diff 1.15}[http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm-Diff-1.15/].\n\nThis is release 1.1.3, fixing several small bugs found over the years. Version\n1.1.0 added new features, including the ability to #patch and #unpatch changes\nas well as a new contextual diff callback, Diff::LCS::ContextDiffCallbacks,\nthat should improve the context sensitivity of patching.\n\nThis library is called Diff::LCS because of an early version of Algorithm::Diff\nwhich was restrictively licensed. This version has seen a minor license change:\ninstead of being under Ruby's license as an option, the third optional license\nis the MIT license.",
