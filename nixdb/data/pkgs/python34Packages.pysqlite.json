   "long_description": "pysqlite is a DB-API 2.0-compliant database interface for SQLite.\n\nSQLite is a relational database management system contained in\na relatively small C library.  It is a public domain project\ncreated by D. Richard Hipp.  Unlike the usual client-server\nparadigm, the SQLite engine is not a standalone process with\nwhich the program communicates, but is linked in and thus\nbecomes an integral part of the program.  The library\nimplements most of SQL-92 standard, including transactions,\ntriggers and most of complex queries.\n\npysqlite makes this powerful embedded SQL engine available to\nPython programmers.  It stays compatible with the Python\ndatabase API specification 2.0 as much as possible, but also\nexposes most of SQLite's native API, so that it is for example\npossible to create user-defined SQL functions and aggregates\nin Python.\n",
