   "long_description": "git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git\nrepository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when\ncommitted, and decrypted when checked out. git-crypt lets you freely\nshare a repository containing a mix of public and private\ncontent. git-crypt gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret\nkey can still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files. This\nlets you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the\nsame repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your\nentire repository.\n",
