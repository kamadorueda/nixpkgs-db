   "long_description": "Ted is a text processor running under X Windows on Unix/Linux systems.\nTed was developed as a standard easy light weight word processor, having\nthe role of Wordpad on MS-Windows. Since then, Ted has evolved to a real\nword processor. It still has the same easy appearance and the same speed\nas the original. The possibility to type a letter, a note or a report\nwith a simple light weight program on a Unix/Linux machine is clearly\nmissing. Ted was made to make it possible to edit rich text documents on\nUnix/Linux in a wysiwyg way. RTF files from Ted are fully compatible with\nMS-Word. Additionally, Ted also is an RTF to PostScript and an RTF to\nAcrobat PDF converter.\n",
