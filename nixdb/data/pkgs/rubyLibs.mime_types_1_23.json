   "long_description": "This library allows for the identification of a file's likely MIME content\ntype. This is release 1.23 that adds the ability to enumerate over the\ncollection of MIME types and updates the sources of a few MIME types. The\nidentification of MIME content type is based on a file's filename extensions.\n\nMIME types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or HTTP\ntraffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. MIME::Types\nprovides the ability for detailed information about MIME entities (provided as\na set of MIME::Type objects) to be determined and used programmatically. There\nare many types defined by RFCs and vendors, so the list is long but not\ncomplete; don't hesitate to ask to add additional information. This library\nfollows the IANA collection of MIME types (see below for reference).\n\nMIME::Types for Ruby was originally based on and synchronized with MIME::Types\nfor Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. As of version 1.15, the data\nformat for the MIME::Type list has changed and the synchronization will no\nlonger happen.\n\nMIME::Types is built to conform to the MIME types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It\nfollows the official {IANA registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/]\n({ftp}[ftp://ftp.iana.org/assignments/media-types]) with some unofficial types\nadded from the the {LTSW collection}[http://www.ltsw.se/knbase/internet/mime.htp].",
