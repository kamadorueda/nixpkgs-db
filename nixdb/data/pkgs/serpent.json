The language, as suggested by its name,\nis designed to be very similar to Python; it is intended to be\nmaximally clean and simple, combining many of the efficiency\nbenefits of a low-level language with ease-of-use in programming\nstyle, and at the same time adding special domain-specific\nfeatures for contract programming.\n",
