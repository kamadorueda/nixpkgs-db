   "long_description": "Diff::LCS computes the difference between two Enumerable sequences using the\nMcIlroy-Hunt longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It includes utilities\nto create a simple HTML diff output format and a standard diff-like tool.\n\nThis is release 1.2.4, fixing a bug introduced after diff-lcs 1.1.3 that did\nnot properly prune common sequences at the beginning of a comparison set.\nThanks to Paul Kunysch for fixing this issue.\n\nCoincident with the release of diff-lcs 1.2.3, we reported an issue with\nRubinius in 1.9 mode\n({rubinius/rubinius#2268}[https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/issues/2268]).\nWe are happy to report that this issue has been resolved.",
