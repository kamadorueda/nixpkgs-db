   "long_description": "NEURON is a simulation environment for developing and exercising models of \n                neurons and networks of neurons. It is particularly well-suited to problems where \n                cable properties of cells play an important role, possibly including extracellular \n                potential close to the membrane), and where cell membrane properties are complex, \n                involving many ion-specific channels, ion accumulation, and second messengers",
