   "long_description": "This package is now part of CEDET, please upgrade.\n\nSemantic is an infrastructure for parser based text analysis in\nEmacs.  It is a lexer, parser-generator, and parser.  It is\nwritten in Emacs Lisp and is customized to the way Emacs thinks\nabout language files, and is optimized to use Emacs' parsing\ncapabilities.\n\nSemantic's goal is to provide an intermediate API for authors of\nlanguage agnostic tools who want to deal with languages in a\ngeneric way.  It also provides a simple way for Mode Authors who\nare experts in their language, to provide a parser for those\ntool authors, without knowing anything about those tools.\n",
