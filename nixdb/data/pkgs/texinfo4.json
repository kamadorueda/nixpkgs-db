   "long_description": "Texinfo is the official documentation format of the GNU project.\nIt was invented by Richard Stallman and Bob Chassell many years\nago, loosely based on Brian Reid's Scribe and other formatting\nlanguages of the time.  It is used by many non-GNU projects as\nwell.\n\nTexinfo uses a single source file to produce output in a number\nof formats, both online and printed (dvi, html, info, pdf, xml,\netc.).  This means that instead of writing different documents\nfor online information and another for a printed manual, you\nneed write only one document.  And when the work is revised, you\nneed revise only that one document.  The Texinfo system is\nwell-integrated with GNU Emacs.\n",
