 "summary": "Revert \"Version update for vxl\", because: - Although the file for 1.14 is in the upstream file repository, it's not   published in their web, which still talks about 1.13 for the stable release. - The cmake files comming with this vxl fail (because of some weird dependency   on a doxygen.cmake file)",
