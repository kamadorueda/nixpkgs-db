 "summary": "Add xps 9560 with its own quirks, I added versions: 1 default one, with nvidia working and intel working, needs optirun to run application with nvidia 2 intel only, I am using this as my daily driver for long time, only intel is turned on and nvidia is turned off and doesn't drain any power. 3 nvidia only, intel is dissabled and nvidia is picked as default gpu, no need to fiddle with optirun etc, good for gpu heavy application.",
