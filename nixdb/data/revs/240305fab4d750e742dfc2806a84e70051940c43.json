 "summary": "* Added mountall.  This is an Ubuntu utility that mounts filesystems   as they become available (as determined by monitoring udev) and   emits Upstart events to inform other jobs that the filesystems are   mounted.  This is very useful for NixOS (which currently ignores   filesystems in the job dependency chain - very bad).",
