 "summary": "* editline: renamed to libedit (which seems to be the proper name for   the package). * Removed the old ghc-wrapper, which hasn't been used for a long time. * Renamed the \"boot\" GHC to \"binary\", which is more descriptive.   (They *can* be used for other things than bootstrapping a GHC   source build.) * Updated the GHC 6.10.1 binary to 6.10.2.",
