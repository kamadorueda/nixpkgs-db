 "summary": "* Updated ntfs-3g to 2011.4.12.  Also create a sbin/mount.ntfs symlink   to ensure that NTFS filesystems are mounted using ntfs-3g, which is   much better than the kernel NTFS driver.  In particular, this   ensures that udisks will automount external NTFS drives with   read/write support.  (See also   http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-faq/#plugandplay)",
