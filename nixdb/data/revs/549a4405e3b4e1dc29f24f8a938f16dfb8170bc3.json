 "summary": "* xulrunner-wrapper: use Firefox 3 directly (via \"firefox -app\"),   since it has full support for running XUL applications.  This saves   a lot of space (you don't need two copies of basically the same   software). * Deleted the old xulrunner (1.8.0.4), it didn't compile anyway with   recent GTK. * Updated chatzilla to 0.9.83.",
