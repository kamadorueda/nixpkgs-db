 "summary": "* Got rid of a lot of \"postInstall=postInstall\" and similar lines in   builders.  These are redundant now. * Inlined some trivial builders. * Removed a few explicit setup-hook creations.  This is done   automatically now if setupHook is set. * Deleted the initscripts package.  NixOS doesn't use it anymore.",
