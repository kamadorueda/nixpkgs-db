 "summary": "Made the linux kernel expressions support 'platform' again (thinking on reusing most of the kernel expressions for the sheevaplug). I still have not added anything in the kernels about cross compilation. I moved the platform definitions out of all-packages. I have not written good platform definitions for the sheevaplug - only for the PC. Only the linux-2.6.32 expression uses the platforms kernelConfig. The linux-2.6.31 was broken, and I left it broken.",
