 "summary": "Big fixes in the cross build: - Before this changes, cflags and ldflags for the native and the cross compiler   got mixed. Not all the gcc-wrapper/gcc-cross-wrapper variables are   independant now, but enough, I think. - Fixed the generic stdenv expression, which did a big mess on buildInputs and   buildNativeInputs. Now it distinguishes when there is a stdenvCross or not.   Maybe we should have a single stdenv and forget about the stdenvCross   adapter - this could end in a stdenv a bit complex, but simpler than the   generic stdenv + adapter. - Added basic support in pkgconfig for cross-builds: a single PKG_CONFIG_PATH   now works for both the cross and the native compilers, but I think this   should work well for most cases I can think of. - I tried to fix the guile expression to cross-biuld; guile is built, but not   its manual, so the derivation still fails. Guile requires patching to   cross-build, as far as I understnad. - Made the glibcCross build to be done through the usage of a   gcc-cross-wrapper over the gcc-cross-stage-static, instead of using it   directly. - Trying to make physfs (a neverball dependency) cross build. - Updated the gcc expression to support building a cross compiler without getting   derivation variables mixed with those of the stdenvCross.",
