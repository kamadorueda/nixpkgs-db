 "summary": "- Add openobex's unusual pkgconfig to pkgconfig path - Prepend dbus_libs pkgconfig to pkgconfig path, as otherwise the dbus-daemon pkgconfig wins,   as it has the same name (dbus-1.pc), which doesn't provide all the dbus headers that are needed - Apply the included patch to obex-data-server which lets it build against current openobex",
