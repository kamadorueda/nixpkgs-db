 "summary": "* Updated the X.org server to 1.8.2.  Note that it no longer depends   on HAL but instead uses udev to autoconfigure input devices.  We'll   have to update the NixOS X server module accordingly, I guess.  See   https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Input_device_configuration. * Updated Mesa to 7.8.2.",
