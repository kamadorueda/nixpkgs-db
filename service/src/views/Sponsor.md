Running the infrastructure for this website is almost free:
- It's hosted on GitHub Pages as static content.
- The database is served as JSON documents from the very same GitHub repository.

Some things are not:
- The developer's stack (laptop, internet).
- The developer's live costs (rent, food, clothes, bills).
- The developer's time!

So one of the best ways to ensure work like this is pushed forward and kept free is [sponsoring the author](https://www.patreon.com/kamadorueda) :)

You'll get my eternal gratitude for it,
and even if you do not: relax! there are other ways of [contributing](http://localhost:3000/nixpkgs-db/#/contributing).
