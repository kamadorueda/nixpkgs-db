   "long_description": "UnQLite is a in-process software library which implements a\nself-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional NoSQL\ndatabase engine. UnQLite is a document store database similar to MongoDB,\nRedis, CouchDB etc. as well a standard Key/Value store similar to\nBerkeleyDB, LevelDB, etc.\n\nUnQLite is an embedded NoSQL (Key/Value store and Document-store) database\nengine. Unlike most other NoSQL databases, UnQLite does not have a\nseparate server process. UnQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary\ndisk files. A complete database with multiple collections, is contained in\na single disk file. The database file format is cross-platform, you can\nfreely copy a database between 32-bit and 64-bit systems or between\nbig-endian and little-endian architectures.\n",
