   "long_description": "Pangolin is a lightweight portable rapid development library for managing\nOpenGL display / interaction and abstracting video input. At its heart is\na simple OpenGl viewport manager which can help to modularise 3D\nvisualisation without adding to its complexity, and offers an advanced\nbut intuitive 3D navigation handler. Pangolin also provides a mechanism\nfor manipulating program variables through config files and ui\nintegration, and has a flexible real-time plotter for visualising\ngraphical data.\n",
