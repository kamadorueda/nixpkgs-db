   "long_description": "This library and tool exists solely because rsync doesn't have file locking.\n\nIt's not used like a normal library; you don't link against it, and you\ndon't have to patch your source code to use it. It's inserted between your\nprogram and its libraries by use of LD_PRELOAD.\n\nFor example:\n\n  $ env LD_PRELOAD=$(nix-build -A pkgs.flockit)/lib/libflockit.so FLOCKIT_FILE_PREFIX=test rsync SRC DEST\n\nBesides the library a handy executable is provided which can simplify the above to:\n\n  $ $(nix-build -A pkgs.flockit)/bin/flockit test rsync SRC DEST\n\nAlso see the following blog post:\nhttps://www.swiftstack.com/blog/2012/08/15/old-school-monkeypatching/\n",
