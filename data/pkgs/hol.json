Built-in decision procedures and theorem provers\ncan automatically establish many simple theorems (users may have\nto prove the hard theorems themselves!) An oracle mechanism\ngives access to external programs such as SMT and BDD\nengines. HOL4 is particularly suitable as a platform for\nimplementing combinations of deduction, execution and property\nchecking.\n\n",
