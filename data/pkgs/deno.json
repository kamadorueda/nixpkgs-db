   "long_description": "Deno aims to be a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern programmer.\nDeno will always be distributed as a single executable.\nGiven a URL to a Deno program, it is runnable with nothing more than the ~15 megabyte zipped executable.\nDeno explicitly takes on the role of both runtime and package manager.\nIt uses a standard browser-compatible protocol for loading modules: URLs.\nAmong other things, Deno is a great replacement for utility scripts that may have been historically written with\nbash or python.\n",
