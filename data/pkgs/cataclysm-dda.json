You may try to\neke out an existence in the forests silently executing threats and\nproviding sustenance with your longbow. You can ride into town in a\njerry-rigged vehicle, all guns blazing, to settle matters in a fug of\nsmoke from your molotovs. You could take a more measured approach and\nconstruct an impregnable fortress, surrounded by traps to protect you from\nthe horrors without. The longer you survive, the more skilled and adapted\nyou will get and the better equipped and armed to deal with the threats\nyou are presented with.\n\nIn the course of your ordeal there will be opportunities and temptations\nto improve or change your very nature.
