   "long_description": "ZenTest provides 4 different tools: zentest, unit_diff, autotest, and\nmultiruby.\n\nZenTest scans your target and unit-test code and writes your missing\ncode based on simple naming rules, enabling XP at a much quicker\npace. ZenTest only works with Ruby and Test::Unit. Nobody uses this\ntool anymore but it is the package namesake, so it stays.\n\nunit_diff is a command-line filter to diff expected results from\nactual results and allow you to quickly see exactly what is wrong.\nDo note that minitest 2.2+ provides an enhanced assert_equal obviating\nthe need for unit_diff\n\nautotest is a continous testing facility meant to be used during\ndevelopment. As soon as you save a file, autotest will run the\ncorresponding dependent tests.\n\nmultiruby runs anything you want on multiple versions of ruby. Great\nfor compatibility checking! Use multiruby_setup to manage your\ninstalled versions.",
