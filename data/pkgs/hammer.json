   "description": "Hammer is a parsing library. Like many modern parsing libraries,\n\t       it provides a parser combinator interface for writing grammars\n\t       as inline domain-specific languages, but Hammer also provides a\n\t       variety of parsing backends. It's also bit-oriented rather than\n\t       character-oriented, making it ideal for parsing binary data such\n\t       as images, network packets, audio, and executables.",
