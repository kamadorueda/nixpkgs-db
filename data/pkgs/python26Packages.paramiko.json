   "long_description": "paramiko is a module for python 2.2 (or higher) that implements the\nSSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to\nremote machines. unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require\nheirarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority. you\nmay know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced telnet and rsh for secure\naccess to remote shells, but the protocol also includes the ability\nto open arbitrary channels to remote services across the encrypted\ntunnel -- this is how sftp works, for example.  it is written\nentirely in python (no C or platform-dependent code) and is released\nunder the GNU LGPL (lesser GPL).
