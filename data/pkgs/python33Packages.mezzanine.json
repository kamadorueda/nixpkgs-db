   "long_description": "Mezzanine is a powerful, consistent, and flexible content management\nplatform. Built using the Django framework, Mezzanine provides a\nsimple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages diving in and\nhacking on the code. Mezzanine is BSD licensed and supported by a\ndiverse and active community.\n\nIn some ways, Mezzanine resembles tools such as Wordpress that provide\nan intuitive interface for managing pages, blog posts, form data, store\nproducts, and other types of content. But Mezzanine is also different.\nUnlike many other platforms that make extensive use of modules or\nreusable applications, Mezzanine provides most of its functionality by\ndefault. This approach yields a more integrated and efficient platform.\n",
