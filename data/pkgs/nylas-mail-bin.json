It is designed to be extensible, so it's easy to create new experiences and workflows around email. Nylas Mail can be enabled with it's requirements by enabling 'services.nylas-mail.enable=true'. Alternatively, make sure to have services.gnome3.gnome-keyring.enable = true; in your configuration.nix before running nylas-mail.
