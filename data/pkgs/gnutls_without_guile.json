Currently the GnuTLS library implements the proposed\nstandards by the IETF's TLS working group.\n\nQuoting from the TLS protocol specification:\n\n\"The TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the\nInternet. The protocol allows client/server applications to\ncommunicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping,\ntampering, or message forgery.\"\n",
