Thereafter, PulseAudio\nimplemented a backend for that interface and became the only way to get\nBluetooth audio with Bluez 5. Users prefering ALSA stayed on Bluez 4.\nHowever, Bluez 4 eventually became deprecated.\n\nThis package is a rebirth of a direct interface between ALSA and Bluez 5,\nthat, unlike PulseAudio, provides KISS near-metal-like experience. It is\nnot possible to run BluezALSA and PulseAudio Bluetooth at the same time\ndue to limitations in Bluez, but it is possible to run PulseAudio over\nBluezALSA if you disable `bluetooth-discover` and `bluez5-discover`\nmodules in PA and configure it to play/capture sound over `bluealsa` PCM.\n",
