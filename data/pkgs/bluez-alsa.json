   "long_description": "Bluez-ALSA (BlueALSA) is an ALSA backend for Bluez 5 audio interface.\nBluez-ALSA registers all Bluetooth devices with audio profiles in Bluez\nunder a virtual ALSA PCM device called `bluealsa` that supports both\nplayback and capture.\n\nSome backstory: Bluez 5 removed built-in support for ALSA in favor of a\ngeneric interface for 3rd party appliations. Thereafter, PulseAudio\nimplemented a backend for that interface and became the only way to get\nBluetooth audio with Bluez 5. Users prefering ALSA stayed on Bluez 4.\nHowever, Bluez 4 eventually became deprecated.\n\nThis package is a rebirth of a direct interface between ALSA and Bluez 5,\nthat, unlike PulseAudio, provides KISS near-metal-like experience. It is\nnot possible to run BluezALSA and PulseAudio Bluetooth at the same time\ndue to limitations in Bluez, but it is possible to run PulseAudio over\nBluezALSA if you disable `bluetooth-discover` and `bluez5-discover`\nmodules in PA and configure it to play/capture sound over `bluealsa` PCM.\n",
