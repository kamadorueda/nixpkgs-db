We remove the normally created\nsite.py's and package it separately instead as it would cause\ncollisions.\n\nFor each module we have a pth file listing the module and all\nits dependencies and we include python-site into the\nPYTHONPATH of wrapped python programs so they can find their\ndependencies.\n",
