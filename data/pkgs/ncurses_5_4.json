   "long_description": "The Ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of\ncurses in System V Release 4.0, and more.  It uses Terminfo\nformat, supports pads and color and multiple highlights and\nforms characters and function-key mapping, and has all the other\nSYSV-curses enhancements over BSD Curses.\n\nThe ncurses code was developed under GNU/Linux.  It has been in\nuse for some time with OpenBSD as the system curses library, and\non FreeBSD and NetBSD as an external package.  It should port\neasily to any ANSI/POSIX-conforming UNIX.  It has even been\nported to OS/2 Warp!\n",
