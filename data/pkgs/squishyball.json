   "long_description": "squishyball is a simple command-line utility for performing\ndouble-blind A/B, A/B/X or X/X/Y testing on the command line.\nThe user specifies two input files to be compared and uses the\nkeyboard during playback to flip between the randomized samples\nto perform on-the-fly compar\u2010 isons.  After a predetermined\nnumber of trials, squishyball prints the trial results to\nstdout and exits.  Results (stdout) may be redirected to a file\nwithout affecting interactive use of the terminal.\n\nsquishyball can also be used to perform casual, non-randomized\ncomparisons of groups of up to ten samples; this is the default\nmode of operation.\n",
