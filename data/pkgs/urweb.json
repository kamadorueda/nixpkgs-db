   "long_description": "Ur is a programming language in the tradition of ML and Haskell, but\nfeaturing a significantly richer type system. Ur is functional, pure,\nstatically-typed, and strict. Ur supports a powerful kind of\nmetaprogramming based on row types.\n\nUr/Web is Ur plus a special standard library and associated rules for\nparsing and optimization. Ur/Web supports construction of dynamic web\napplications backed by SQL databases. The signature of the standard\nlibrary is such that well-typed Ur/Web programs \"don't go wrong\" in a\nvery broad sense. Not only do they not crash during particular page\ngenerations, but they also may not:\n\n* Suffer from any kinds of code-injection attacks\n* Return invalid HTML\n* Contain dead intra-application links\n* Have mismatches between HTML forms and the fields expected by their handlers\n* Include client-side code that makes incorrect assumptions about the \"AJAX\"-style services that the remote web server provides\n* Attempt invalid SQL queries\n* Use improper marshaling or unmarshaling in communication with SQL databases or between browsers and web servers\n\nThis type safety is just the foundation of the Ur/Web methodology. It is\nalso possible to use metaprogramming to build significant application pieces\nby analysis of type structure. For instance, the demo includes an ML-style\nfunctor for building an admin interface for an arbitrary SQL table. The\ntype system guarantees that the admin interface sub-application that comes\nout will always be free of the above-listed bugs, no matter which well-typed\ntable description is given as input.\n\nThe Ur/Web compiler also produces very efficient object code that does not use\ngarbage collection.
