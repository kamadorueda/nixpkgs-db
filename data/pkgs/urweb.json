It is\nalso possible to use metaprogramming to build significant application pieces\nby analysis of type structure. For instance, the demo includes an ML-style\nfunctor for building an admin interface for an arbitrary SQL table. The\ntype system guarantees that the admin interface sub-application that comes\nout will always be free of the above-listed bugs, no matter which well-typed\ntable description is given as input.\n\nThe Ur/Web compiler also produces very efficient object code that does not use\ngarbage collection. These compiled programs will often be even more efficient\nthan what most programmers would bother to write in C. For example, the\nstandalone web server generated for the demo uses less RAM than the bash shell.\nThe compiler also generates JavaScript versions of client-side code, with no need\nto write those parts of applications in a different language.\n",
