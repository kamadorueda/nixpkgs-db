   "long_description": "Xerces2 Java is a library for parsing, validating and manipulating\n          XML documents.\n\n          Xerces 2.x introduced the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a\n          complete framework for building parser components and\n          configurations that is extremely modular and easy to program.  XNI\n          is merely an internal set of interfaces.  There is no need for an\n          XML application programmer to learn XNI if they only intend to\n          interface to the Xerces2 parser using standard interfaces like\n          JAXP, DOM, and SAX.  Xerces developers and application developers\n          that need more power and flexibility than that provided by the\n          standard interfaces should read and understand XNI.\n",
