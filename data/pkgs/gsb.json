   "long_description": "a strategy / management / simulation game that does away with all the\nbase building and delays and gets straight to the meat and potatoes of\nscience-fiction games : The big space battles fought by huge spaceships with\ntons of laser beams and things going 'zap!', 'ka-boom!' and 'ka-pow!'. In GSB\nyou put your ships together from modular components, arrange them into fleets,\ngive your ships orders of engagement and then hope they emerge victorious from\nbattle (or at least blow to bits in aesthetically pleasing ways).\n",
