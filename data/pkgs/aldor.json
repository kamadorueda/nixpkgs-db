   "long_description": "Aldor is a programming language with an expressive type system well-suited\nfor mathematical computing and which has been used to develop a number of\ncomputer algebra libraries. Originally known as A#, Aldor was conceived as\nan extension language for the Axiom system, but is now used more in other settings.\nIn Aldor, types and functions are first class values that can be constructed\nand manipulated within programs. Pervasive support for dependent types allows\nstatic checking of dynamic objects. What does this mean for a normal user? Aldor\nsolves many difficulties encountered in widely-used object-oriented programming\nlanguages. It allows programs to use a natural style, combining the more attractive\nand powerful properties of functional, object-oriented and aspect-oriented styles.\n",
