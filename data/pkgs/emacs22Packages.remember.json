   "long_description": "Remember is an Emacs mode for quickly remembering data.  It uses\nwhatever back-end is appropriate to record and correlate the\ndata, but its main intention is to allow you to express as\nlittle structure as possible up front.\n\nWhen you enter data, either by typing it into a buffer, or using\nthe contents of the selected region, Remember will store that\ndata -- unindexed, uninterpreted -- in a data pool.  It will\nalso try to remember as much context information as possible\n(any text properties that were set, where you copied it from,\nwhen, how, etc).  Later, you can walk through your accumulated\nset of data (both organized, and unorganized) and easily begin\nmoving things around, and making annotations that will express\nthe full meaning of that data, as far as you know it.\n",
