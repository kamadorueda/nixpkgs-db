   "long_description": "MBT is a memory-based tagger-generator and tagger in one. The tagger-generator part can generate a sequence tagger on the basis of a training set of tagged sequences; the tagger part can tag new sequences. MBT can, for instance, be used to generate part-of-speech taggers or chunkers for natural language processing. It has also been used for named-entity recognition, information extraction in domain-specific texts, and disfluency chunking in transcribed speech.\n\nMbt is used by Frog for Dutch tagging.\n",
