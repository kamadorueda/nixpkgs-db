   "long_description": "Primecoin is an innovative cryptocurrency, a form of digital\ncurrency secured by cryptography and issued through a\ndecentralized mining market. Derived from Satoshi Nakamoto's\nBitcoin, Primecoin introduces an unique form of proof-of-work\nbased on prime numbers.\n\nThe innovative prime proof-of-work in Primecoin not only\nprovides security and minting to the network, but also generates\na special form of prime number chains of interest to mathematical\nresearch. Thus primecoin network is energy-multiuse, compared to\nbitcoin.\n",
