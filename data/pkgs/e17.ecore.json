   "long_description": "Enlightenment's Ecore is a clean and tiny event loop library\nwith many modules to do lots of convenient things for a\nprogrammer, to save time and effort.\n\nIt's small and lean, designed to work on embedded systems all\nthe way to large and powerful multi-cpu workstations. It\nserialises all system signals, events etc. into a single event\nqueue, that is easily processed without needing to worry about\nconcurrency. A properly written, event-driven program using this\nkind of programming doesn't need threads, nor has to worry about\nconcurrency. It turns a program into a state machine, and makes\nit very robust and easy to follow.\n",
