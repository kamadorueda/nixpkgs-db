   "long_description": "GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor\u2014and more.  At its\ncore is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp\nprogramming language with extensions to support text editing.\n\nThe features of GNU Emacs include: content-sensitive editing modes,\nincluding syntax coloring, for a wide variety of file types including\nplain text, source code, and HTML; complete built-in documentation,\nincluding a tutorial for new users; full Unicode support for nearly all\nhuman languages and their scripts; highly customizable, using Emacs\nLisp code or a graphical interface; a large number of extensions that\nadd other functionality, including a project planner, mail and news\nreader, debugger interface, calendar, and more.  Many of these\nextensions are distributed with GNU Emacs; others are available\nseparately.\n\nThis is \"Mac port\" addition to GNU Emacs 24. This provides a native\nGUI support for Mac OS X 10.4 - 10.9. Note that Emacs 23 and later\nalready contain the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for\nMac OS X 10.4 and later. So if it is good enough for you, then you\ndon't need to try this.\n",
