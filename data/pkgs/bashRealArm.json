Bash is an sh-compatible\nshell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell\n(ksh) and C shell (csh).  It is intended to conform to the IEEE\nPOSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.  It offers\nfunctional improvements over sh for both programming and\ninteractive use.  In addition, most sh scripts can be run by\nBash without modification.\n",
