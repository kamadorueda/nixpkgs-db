It\nwas designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer as well as\nthe various operating system kernel interfaces. Stress-ng features:\n\n  * over 210 stress tests\n  * over 50 CPU specific stress tests that exercise floating point, integer,\n    bit manipulation and control flow\n  * over 20 virtual memory stress tests\n  * portable: builds on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, Minix, Android, MacOS X,\n    Debian Hurd, Haiku, Windows Subsystem for Linux and SunOs/Dilos with\n    gcc, clang, tcc and pcc.\n\nstress-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip hardware\nissues such as thermal overruns as well as operating system bugs that only\noccur when a system is being thrashed hard. Use stress-ng with caution as some\nof the tests can make a system run hot on poorly designed hardware and also can\ncause excessive system thrashing which may be difficult to stop.\n\nstress-ng can also measure test throughput rates; this can be useful to observe\nperformance changes across different operating system releases or types of\nhardware. However, it has never been intended to be used as a precise benchmark\ntest suite, so do NOT use it in this manner.\n",
