Hedgehogs may move\naround the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping\nbut also by using particular tools such as the \"Rope\" or \"Parachute\", to\nmove to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to\nensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or\nmoving.\n\nA large variety of tools and weapons are available for players during\nthe game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee, Shotgun,\nDesert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine, Rope, Pneumatic\npick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause explosions that deform\nthe terrain, removing circular chunks. The landscape is an island\nfloating on a body of water, or a restricted cave with water at the\nbottom. A hedgehog dies when it enters the water (either by falling off\nthe island, or through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off\neither side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from\ncontact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the attacked\nhedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is shown only when\nall movement on the battlefield has ceased).",
