   "long_description": "Armory is the most secure and full featured solution available for users\nand institutions to generate and store Bitcoin private keys. This means\nusers never have to trust the Armory team and can use it with the Glacier\nProtocol. Satoshi would be proud!\n\nUsers are empowered with multiple encrypted Bitcoin wallets and permanent\none-time \u2018paper backups\u2019. Armory pioneered cold storage and distributed\nmulti-signature. Bitcoin cold storage is a system for securely storing\nBitcoins on a completely air-gapped offline computer.\n\nMaintainer's note: The original authors at https://bitcoinarmory.com/\ndiscontinued development. I elected instead to package GitHub user\n@goatpig's fork, as it's the most active, at time of this writing.\n",
