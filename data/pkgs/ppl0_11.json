   "long_description": "The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions\nespecially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and\nverification of complex systems.  These abstractions include convex\npolyhedra, defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open or\nclosed) halfspaces, each described by a linear inequality (strict or\nnon-strict) with rational coefficients; some special classes of\npolyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs;\nand grids which represent regularly spaced points that satisfy a set of\nlinear congruence relations.  The library also supports finite\npowersets and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids and a mixed\ninteger linear programming problem solver using an exact-arithmetic\nversion of the simplex algorithm.\n",
