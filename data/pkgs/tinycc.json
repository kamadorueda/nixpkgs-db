Compilation is so fast\nthat your script will be as fast as if it was an executable.\n\nTCC can also automatically generate memory and bound checks while\nallowing all C pointers operations.  TCC can do these checks even\nif non patched libraries are used.\n\nWith libtcc, you can use TCC as a backend for dynamic code\ngeneration.\n",
