   "long_description": "The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for\nthe distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of\ncomputers using a simple programming model. It is designed to\nscale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each\noffering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on\nhardware to deliver high-avaiability, the library itself is\ndesigned to detect and handle failures at the application layer,\nso delivering a highly-availabile service on top of a cluster of\ncomputers, each of which may be prone to failures.\n",
