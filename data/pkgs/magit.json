You can review and commit the changes you have made to the\ntracked files, for example, and you can browse the history of past\nchanges. There is support for cherry picking, reverting, merging,\nrebasing, and other common Git operations.\n\nMagit is not a complete interface to Git; it just aims to make the\nmost common Git operations convenient. Thus, Magit will likely not\nsave you from learning Git itself.\n",
