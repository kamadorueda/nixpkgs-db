By providing a stable and small core\nsystem, excellent dev tools, and maintained releases, Pharo is an\nattractive platform to build and deploy mission critical applications.\n\nThis package provides the executable VM. You should probably not care\nabout this package (which represents a packaging detail) and have a\nlook at the pharo-vm-core package instead.\n\nPlease fill bug reports on http://bugs.pharo.org under the 'Ubuntu\npackaging (ppa:pharo/stable)' project.\n",
