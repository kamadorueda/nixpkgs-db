   "long_description": "CEDET is a collection of tools written with the end goal of\ncreating an advanced development environment in Emacs.\n\nEmacs already is a great environment for writing software, but\nthere are additional areas that need improvement.  Many new\nideas for integrated environments have been developed in newer\nproducts, such as JBuilder, Eclipse, or KDevelop.  CEDET is a\nproject which brings together several different tools needed to\nimplement advanced features.\n\nCEDET includes EIEIO (Enhanced Implementation of Emacs\nInterpreted Objects), Semantic, SRecode, Speedbar, EDE (Emacs\nDevelopment Environment), and COGRE (COnnected GRaph Editor).\n",
