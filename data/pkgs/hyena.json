It contains a lot of random things,\nincluding useful data structures, a Sqlite-based db layer, cool widgets, a JSON library,\na smart job/task scheduler, a user-query/search parser, and much more. It's particularly\nuseful for Gtk# applications, though only the Hyena.Gui assembly requires Gtk#.\n",
