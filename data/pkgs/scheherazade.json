   "long_description": "Scheherazade, named after the heroine of the classic Arabian Nights tale,\nis designed in a similar style to traditional typefaces such as Monotype\nNaskh, extended to cover the Unicode Arabic repertoire through Unicode\n8.0.\n\nScheherazade provides a \u201csimplified\u201d rendering of Arabic script, using\nbasic connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional\nligatures or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef\nligatures). This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,\nespecially in non-Arabic languages, but may not be considered appropriate\nin situations where a more elaborate style of calligraphy is preferred.\n\nThis package contains the regular and bold styles for the Scheherazade\nfont family, along with documentation.\n",
