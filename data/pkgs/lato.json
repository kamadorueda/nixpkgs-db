   "long_description": "Lato is a sans-serif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by\nWarsaw-based designer \u0141ukasz Dziedzic (\"Lato\" means \"Summer\" in Polish).\nIn December 2010 the Lato family was published under the open-source Open\nFont License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.\n\nIn 2013-2014, the family was greatly extended to cover 3000+ glyphs per\nstyle. The Lato 2.010 family now supports 100+ Latin-based languages, 50+\nCyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA phonetics. In the\nprocess, the metrics and kerning of the family have been revised and four\nadditional weights were created.\n",
