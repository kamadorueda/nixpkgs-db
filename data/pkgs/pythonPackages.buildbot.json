   "long_description": "The BuildBot is a system to automate the compile/test cycle\n          required by most software projects to validate code changes.  By\n          automatically rebuilding and testing the tree each time something\n          has changed, build problems are pinpointed quickly, before other\n          developers are inconvenienced by the failure.  The guilty\n          developer can be identified and harassed without human\n          intervention.  By running the builds on a variety of platforms,\n          developers who do not have the facilities to test their changes\n          everywhere before checkin will at least know shortly afterwards\n          whether they have broken the build or not.  Warning counts, lint\n          checks, image size, compile time, and other build parameters can\n          be tracked over time, are more visible, and are therefore easier\n          to improve.\n\n          The overall goal is to reduce tree breakage and provide a platform\n          to run tests or code-quality checks that are too annoying or\n          pedantic for any human to waste their time with.  Developers get\n          immediate (and potentially public) feedback about their changes,\n          encouraging them to be more careful about testing before checking\n          in code.\n",
