   "long_description": "PAKCS is an implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language\nCurry jointly developed by the Portland State University, the Aachen\nUniversity of Technology, and the University of Kiel. Although this is\nnot a highly optimized implementation but based on a high-level\ncompilation of Curry programs into Prolog programs, it is not a toy\nimplementation but has been used for a variety of applications (e.g.,\ngraphical programming environments, an object-oriented front-end for\nCurry, partial evaluators, database applications, HTML programming\nwith dynamic web pages, prototyping embedded systems).\n",
