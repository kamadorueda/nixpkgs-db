   "long_description": "Unix's `time` utility is a simple and often effective way of measuring\nhow long a command takes to run. Unfortunately, running a command once\ncan give misleading timings: the process may create a cache on its first\nexecution, running faster subsequently; other processes may cause the\ncommand to be starved of CPU or IO time; etc. It is common to see people\nrun `time` several times and take whichever values they feel most\ncomfortable with. Inevitably, this causes problems.\n\n`multitime` is, in essence, a simple extension to time which runs a\ncommand multiple times and prints the timing means (with confidence\nintervals), standard deviations, minimums, medians, and maximums having\ndone so. This can give a much better understanding of the command's\nperformance.\n",
