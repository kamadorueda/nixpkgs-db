   "long_description": "This library and command line tool were designed as near drop-in\nreplacements for common SHA-1 libraries and sha1sum. They will\ncompute the SHA-1 hash of any given file and additionally will\ndetect cryptanalytic collision attacks against SHA-1 present in\neach file. It is very fast and takes less than twice the amount\nof time as regular SHA-1.\n",
