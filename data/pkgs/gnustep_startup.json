The\nmake package allows you to setup a simple and powerful system for\nbuilding, installing and packaging your tools. The base package\nincludes all the classes necessary for writing an incredible array of\ntools, from wrappers for system tools to tools for communicating with\nweb and other types of servers.\n\n...and a graphical development kit\n\nThe core libraries contain classes for developing a complete\ngraphical application for almost any purpose. Along with our\nobject-oriented, graphical development applications,\nProjectCenter and Gorm it's simple to write very complex\ncommercial applications in weeks or months, rather than years\n(or often, never) in the case of other development environments.\n\n...and a cross platform development environment\n\nGNUstep can, currently, allow you to build applications on\nGNU/Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and any\nPOSIX compliant UNIX based operating system.\n",
