   "long_description": "Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media\nstreaming servers. It began as the successor of the old \"shout\"\nutility, and has since gained a lot of useful features.\n\nIn its basic mode of operation, it streams media files or data\nfrom standard input without reencoding and thus requires only\nvery little CPU resources.\n",
