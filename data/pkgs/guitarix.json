   "long_description": "  guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running with\nJACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit). It is free as in speech and\nfree as in beer. Its free sourcecode allows to build it for\nother UNIX-like systems also, namely for BSD and for MacOSX.\n\n  It takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would do:\nas a mono-signal from your sound card. Your tone is processed by\na main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately and\ndeliver a processed stereo-signal via JACK. You may fill the\nrack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules spanning\nfrom a simple noise-gate to brain-slashing modulation-fx like\nflanger, phaser or auto-wah. Your signal is processed with\nminimum latency. On any properly set-up Linux-system you do not\nneed to wait for more than 10 milli-seconds for your playing to\nbe delivered, processed by guitarix.\n\n  guitarix offers the range of sounds you would expect from a\nfull-featured universal guitar-amp. You can get crisp\nclean-sounds, nice overdrive, fat distortion and a diversity of\ncrazy sounds never heard before.\n",
