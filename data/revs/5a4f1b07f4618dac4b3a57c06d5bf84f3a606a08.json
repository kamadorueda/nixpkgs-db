 "summary": "Adding xfontsel. A bit hacky (to work well, it requires copying its app-defaults to $HOME) As app-defaults should be installed with the libXt (maybe it's libXt which loads them), and stracing that is the place where the code looks for app-defaults (the libXt store path), I don't know of any better solution in nixpkgs by now.",
