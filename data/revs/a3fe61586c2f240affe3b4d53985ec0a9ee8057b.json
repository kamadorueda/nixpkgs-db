 "summary": "* Updated KDE to 4.5.5. * Removed the KDE version number from all expressions except the   top-level default.nix.  This makes it easier to upgrade. * Deleted the old l10n versions since there doesn't seem to be a good   reason to keep them around. * Don't use replaceChars (slow!) but do the name sanitization in   l10n-manifest.sh.",
