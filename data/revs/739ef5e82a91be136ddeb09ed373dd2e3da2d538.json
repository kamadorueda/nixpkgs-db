 "summary": "* Various hacks needed to get the NVIDIA driver to build on   Linux 2.6.28.  In particular the arch-specific headers   are in a different place now.  (I'd like to do \"make   headers_install\", but it doesn't install all the headers   that are needed to build external kernel modules.  What   a mess.) * Add Linux 2.6.28 to the channel.",
